Tiny-Fu Version 2.0
-------------------

I have been thinking about the creation of version 2 of Tiny-Fu for a long
time. The main goal for this cycle of Tiny-Fu development is to radically
change the way Scheme based scripts are run. 

Version 2 of Tiny-Fu will no longer operate as a GIMP extension. Scheme
based scripts will be run using a standalone interpreter in a similar
fashion to how Python or Perl scripts are currently run.

The main changes to the build and installation system have already been
worked out. The restructuring of the code which forms the glue between
the Scheme interpreter and GIMP is still to be done. You should expect
this GIMP plug-in to be broken while the needed changes are implemented.
