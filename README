Tiny-Fu Version 1.2
-------------------

Tiny-Fu has been brought up-to-date with all of the changes that have been
made in the Script-Fu plug-in of GIMP (up to the 2.4.1 release) since the
Tiny-Fu code was merged in to Script-Fu. This version of Tiny-Fu is again
functionally identical to the Script-Fu plug-in of GIMP.

Now that Tiny-Fu and Script-Fu are again in sync with each other, there will
be no more releases or development in the 1.x series of Tiny-Fu. Any further
development related to version 1 of Tiny-Fu (all versions up to and including
1.2) will continue in the Script-Fu plug-in of the GIMP source tree.

Work will soon begin on version 2 of Tiny-Fu. This new version will no
longer operate as an GIMP extension. Scheme based scripts will be run
using a standalone interpreter in a similar fashion to how Python or
Perl scripts are currently run.
