This directory contains a version of TinyScheme which has been modified
to support UTF-8 coded strings. The strings stored in a data cell are
expected to be in UTF-8 format. This allows the continued use of gchar
pointers to pass around the strings. Processing the strings will require
conversion to unicode at times depending on the specific operation that
needs to be done on the UTF-8 coded strings.

The string length value stored in a data cell is the length in bytes of that
string including the terminating NUL.

Routines that want a string length for a UTF-8 coded string will be passed
the number of characters and not the number of bytes. If the number of bytes
is needed, the normal call to strlen() will work.
