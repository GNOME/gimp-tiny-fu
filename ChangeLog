2005-03-04  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c: Added support for SF-REGION. SF-BOUNDARY,

2005-02-23  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c: Reverted previous change. Can't add an API

2005-01-09  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/Makefile.am:
	* scripts/asc2img.sct: Removed this script as it is supposedly broken
	beyond repair (according to Sven Neumann) and the functionality is in
	the text tool itself.

	* scripts/frosty-logo.sct: made sure the shadow is given enough space
	and then truncated instead of translated to the center of the image,
	thus preventing the display of shadows with a completely horizontal or
	vertical edge. From a fix in Script-Fu by Shlomi Fish. Fixes bug
	#132145.

2004-12-25  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/weave.sct: Limit the "Thread intensity" parameter to [0..100]

	* TODO: Added idea of counting brackets in TinyScheme.

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.c (tiny_fu_script_proc): Don't look at the

	after the call to script-fu-register.

	Updates based on changes made by Michael Natterer to Script-Fu.

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.c: Pass untranslated menu_paths to the
	core, not translated ones. Don't store the scripts directly in the
	"script_list" tree but use a list of scripts per key because there
	can be identical keys for different scripts now. Renamed variable
	"script_list" to "script_tree" because it's a GTree. Sort the SFMenu
	structs by their menu_paths *and* the procedure's menu_labels. Fixes
	menu item sorting after "Refresh".

2004-11-21  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/erase-rows.sct: Applied patch from BM which makes the
	script work layers that have their top-left corner at a position

	by Sven Neumann to the Script-Fu version of the script.

	and pass just the menu label in script-fu-register.

2004-11-18  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu.c
	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.c
	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.h: Added support for (tiny-fu-menu-register)
	to allow scripts to register their menu_paths the same undeprecated
	way as plug-ins. Fixes bug #158117. Renamed tiny_fu_find_scripts() to
	tiny_fu_load_all_scripts(). Added calls to gettext() since TinyScheme
	no longer translates marked strings. In tiny_fu_script_proc() changed
	some uses of 'params' variable that should have been 'param'.

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-interface.c: Added a utility function to reduce
	code duplication.

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c: Added support for (tiny-fu-menu-register).

	* scripts/text-circle.sct: Use the new drawable_foo_default()
	functions instead of drawable_foo_defaults() to be consistent
	with paintbrush_default() and friends.

	* Makefile.am: Added NEWS to the list of files in EXTRA_DIST.

	* scripts/font-map.sct
	* scripts/slide.sct

	undo-group-start/end.

2004-11-10  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-interface.c (tiny_fu_interface): don't silently
	return when there is already a script running but show a message
	instead. Fixes bug #123882.

2004-10-29  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c (init_constants): Re-added the deprecated

	* tiny-fu/gimp-constants.h: Removed since it is no longer needed.

2004-10-24  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	Applied changes made to the autogen.sh file of GIMP.

	* autogen.sh: don't tell nonsense by printing "I am going to run
	./configure with no arguments", because we always pass at least
	--enable-maintainer-mode. Instead, simply always print all
	arguments. Also removed --copy from the calls to glib-gettextize
	and intltoolize. (Michael Natterer)

	* autogen.sh: Add support for automake 1.9. Also rm autom4te.cache,
	since it might interfere with differing autoconf versions.
	(Manish Singh)

	* scripts/alien-glow-logo.sct
	* scripts/basic2-logo.sct
	* scripts/gradient-bevel-logo.sct: use "Sans Bold" instead of
	"Futura_Poster". The underscore in the font name used to confuse
	intltool (bug #137029) and the freefont package isn't that widely
	used any longer anyway.

2004-10-12  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* autogen.sh: removed reference to libtool in the "I am testing ..."
	message since libtool isn't used.

	array is different from the previous argument specifying the size
	as suggested by Michael Natterer. (Fixes bug #154266)
