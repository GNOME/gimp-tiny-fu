2005-05-30  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/guides-new-percent.sct
	* scripts/guides-new.sct: Don't use undo groups. It's useless for a

	Natterer to Script-Fu.

2005-05-30  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	Updates based on changes made by Tor Lillqvist to Script-Fu.

	* configure.in: Don't bother looking for fd_set on Win32, we won't
	find it in sys/types.h or (the nonexistent) sys/select.h anyway.
	(It's in winsock2.h.)

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-server.c: Give it a chance to work on Win32 by
	covering for the differences between the WinSock and Unix socket APIs.
	Use recv() and send() instead of read() and write() on sockets. On
	Win32, use closesocket() for sockets instead of close(). Don't use
	perror() or look at errno after socket API errors on Win32. No EINTR
	failure mode with WinSock 2.
	(print_socket_api_error): New function. On Unix, just call perror().
	On Win32, call WSAGetLastError() and produce an appropriate error
	message on stderr.

	* tiny-fu/Makefile.am (WINSOCK_LIBS): Link with the winsock2 library,
	as we compile with the winsock2 header.

2005-05-30  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	when calling gimp_plugin_domain_register() and pass proper locale
	directory. From a change made to gimp_plugin_template by Michael
	Natterer. Fixes problem of menus not being translated.

	* tiny-fu/Makefile.am: Define LOCALEDIR needed as part of above fix.

2005-04-17  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/asc2img.sct: Removed this script as it is supposedly broken
	beyond repair (according to Sven Neumann) and the functionality is in
	the text tool itself.

	* scripts/frosty-logo.sct: made sure the shadow is given enough space
	and then truncated instead of translated to the center of the image,
	thus preventing the display of shadows with a completely horizontal or
	vertical edge. From a fix in Script-Fu by Shlomi Fish. Fixes bug #132145.

2004-12-25  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/weave.sct: Limit the "Thread intensity" parameter to [0..100]

	Updates based on changes made by Michael Natterer to Script-Fu.

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.c: Pass untranslated menu_paths to the
	core, not translated ones. Don't store the scripts directly in the
	"script_list" tree but use a list of scripts per key because there
	can be identical keys for different scripts now. Renamed variable
	"script_list" to "script_tree" because it's a GTree. Sort the SFMenu
	structs by their menu_paths *and* the procedure's menu_labels. Fixes
	menu item sorting after "Refresh".

2004-11-21  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* scripts/erase-rows.sct: Applied patch from BM which makes the
	script work layers that have their top-left corner at a position

	and pass just the menu label in script-fu-register.

2004-11-18  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu.c
	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.c
	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-scripts.h: Added support for (tiny-fu-menu-register)
	to allow scripts to register their menu_paths the same undeprecated
	way as plug-ins. Fixes bug #158117. Renamed tiny_fu_find_scripts() to
	tiny_fu_load_all_scripts(). Added calls to gettext() since TinyScheme
	no longer translates marked strings. In tiny_fu_script_proc() changed
	some uses of 'params' variable that should have been 'param'.

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-interface.c: Added a utility function to reduce
	code duplication.

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c: Added support for (tiny-fu-menu-register).

	* tiny-fu/tiny-fu-interface.c (tiny_fu_interface): don't silently
	return when there is already a script running but show a message
	instead. Fixes bug #123882.

2004-10-29  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>

	* tiny-fu/ts-wrapper.c (init_constants): Re-added the deprecated

	from Sven Neumann which uses gimp_int_combo_box_connect() so

	run. Fixes bug #156659.

	Applied changes made to the autogen.sh file of GIMP.

	* autogen.sh: don't tell nonsense by printing "I am going to run
	./configure with no arguments", because we always pass at least
	--enable-maintainer-mode. Instead, simply always print all
	arguments. Also removed --copy from the calls to glib-gettextize
	and intltoolize. (Michael Natterer)

	* autogen.sh: Add support for automake 1.9. Also rm autom4te.cache,

	long and useless help text.

2004-10-01  Kevin Cozens  <kcozens@cvs.gnome.org>
