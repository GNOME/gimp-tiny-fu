Bugs:
- The scripts-update.pl script isn't converting gimp-blend to gimp-edit-blend
  when the statement is split over two lines.
- Windows related problems (from schumaml)
  o no script-fu server
  DONE??

Script bugs:
- Image/Alchemy/Predator seg faults when "Separate layer" box is not ticked.
  Results in call ("plug_in_max_rgb" 1 1 -1 0) and error seg fault
  #4  main_function (drawable=0x0, preview_mode=0) at max_rgb.c:222
  #5  0x08049c44 in run (name=0x96e6100 "plug_in_max_rgb", nparams=4,
  #6  0x00fea8f5 in gimp_proc_run (proc_run=0x96e60c0) at gimp.c:1712
  #7  0x00fea704 in gimp_loop () at gimp.c:1557
  #8  0x00fe973e in gimp_main (info=0xbfff49a5, argc=6, argv=0xbffd5ef4)
  #9  0x08049b52 in main (argc=6, argv=0xbffd5ef4) at max_rgb.c:90
Dies at the call to (pixelize 1 img -1 3)
- Image/Render/Circuit seg faults when "Separate layer" box is not ticked.
  plug-in-maze is the problem.


ToDo:
- A line beginning with a ; just before some close brackets will result in
  'syntax error: illegal token 1'.
- E-mail GIMP devel list to ask plug-in authors to improve error checking.
- Submit patch for updates to Script-Fu scripts so Tiny-Fu can run them.
- Add check to make sure number of args in call matches number of args
  specified when script was registered.
  I added an item to the register list in test-sphere but not to the define
  statement and it didn't catch the discrepancy.
- Add a script under the Utils menu that turns off tracing and restores undo.
- Test the ability to call a Tiny-Fu script from within a Tiny-Fu script.
- (let ((foo (cons-array 1))) (gimp-parasite-attach (list "bar" 0 foo)))
  gives the message "Error: not enough arguments".
  It should display the name of the item for which there are missing args.
- Add UTF-8 support to TinyScheme
  <mitch> a safe place to start is probably to simply g_utf8_validate() the
  whole script upon loading. after that, all strings you get from gtk widgets
  are utf-8 already
- Change Tiny-Fu from an extension to a regular plug-in.
- Create some demonstration scripts using the tsx (and re) extensions
	o Create thumbnails
	o Web gallery
		thumbnails + html pages to show them and link to the originals images
	o Create a contact sheet (DONE)
- Clean up the changes re: putting error messages in to a buffer. Send the
  code changes to TinyScheme author.
- The print_flag variable should only be set to 1 for the console mode.
- Test the plug-ins text console mode.
- Check if there are other places where is_pair() is being called instead
  of is_list().
- Check for valid return values from mk_*() calls to TinyScheme.
  If they can return sc->NIL, test for it before using the pointer.
- Are there other loops looking for NULL pointer when traversing that is
  supposed to be a list instead of testing against sc->NIL?
- Use a call to scheme_define() instead of building a string which is passed
  to scheme_load_string() to define the stuff needed to call a C routine?
- Create/update gimp-help info for Tiny-Fu plugin.
- Autoconf/configure issues.
- Update the information in the ftx-functions.txt file to indicate that ftx
  is based on the TinyScheme tsx extensions.
- Reformat the source files to conform to GIMP coding standards.
- Document a suggested coding style for Tiny-Fu scripts.

- The SIOD fread routine can not simply be redefined to use read.
  Mostly done.
- Scripts should live in their own namespace. This will avoid problems which
  might arise between scripts with the same name for a function but which have
  perform different tasks. See Simon Budig's rewrite of the alien-glow-arrow
  script in Script-Fu.
  Done?
- Add extra tests/messages when parsing data to be passed to GIMP in the
  marshalling routine.
  DONE
- The strexp() routine in TinyScheme can only read up to a maximum of 256
  characters (the size of strbuff[]). 
  DONE
- Update script which updates Script-Fu scripts to the current API.
  DONE
- Fix the creation of error messages. Don't use g_snprintf()??
  Don't append to end of sc->linebuff in putchars(). If printing an error
  it should output to the error[] part of the sc structure.
  DONE
- Test PDB routines which return no values.
  Fixed?
- Add tests to ensure the right type of array was passed to marshalling code.
  DONE
- Test passing of array data to GIMP.
  DONE (finally AFAICT!)
- Check for UTF-8 support in the regex and file I/O run-time loadable
  extensions. Add the support if it isn't already there.
  DONE
- Trying to load 96 scripts causes TinyScheme to report "No memory".
  Need to increase number of cells allocated on startup or have it dynamically
  add more cells as needed (up to a specified maximum?).
  DONE
- Perform further testing on the support for parasites.
  DONE
- Add "Save output" button to the console mode screen. (Enhancement)
  DONE (Won't be done for GIMP 2.0.3)
- Add "Clear output" button to the console mode screen.
  DONE
- A call to gimp-displays-flush results in "car: argument 1 must be: pair"
  Fixed by change to marshalling code which ensures a list is always returned
  from all PDB calls?
- Reformat the scripts to conform to the suggested coding style.
  Mostly done. Some scripts may still need to be reformatted.
- Remove the use of a pipe in console mode (see bug #139200)
  DONE
- Update compatibility definition for rand to force argument to exact type.
  DONE
- Determine where to place the run time loadable extensions which can be
  used by TinyScheme.
  DONE.


Error handling:
- If code in ts-wrapper.c detects an error condition when loading or running
  any of the scripts, it should generate an error message, store the message
  in a buffer, and return an error indication to the Scheme interpreter.
- The scheme code which calls the marshalling routine in ts-wrapper.c should
  check for an error being returned from the called function. If the returned
  values indicate an error occured it should throw an error (ie. call the
  Scheme based error handling routine).
- If a calling or execution error occurs, let the script handle it. If the
  script isn't set to handle it, then pop up a dialog box and abort the script.
- The console mode should probably have an error handler to just display the
  error in the console window.


Error reporting:
o unknown types in register portion of a script
o wrong types passed for a given argument to a script
o wrong array type passed as argument where an array type was expected.
o procedure being executed when an error occured
o line and position in line where error was encountered when reading a file


TinyScheme issues:
- The printslashstring() routine in scheme.c looks very inefficient.
- Use a #define instead of a hard-coded value in oblist_initial_value().
- Use a #define instead of a hard-coded value in new_frame_in_env().
- Submit additional patches and comments to TinyScheme to original author.
- In marshall_db_proc_call(), why are some numbers passed to the foreign
  function as number rather than integer?
- Why do some interface items take *sc while some do not?

- store_string() should use a memcpy() or memmove() instead of strcpy()
  to allow it for use in storing binary data that might contain NULs
  This may also require a fix to the routine which returns the length of
  stored strings.
  DONE. No longer needed?
